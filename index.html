		<p class="intro"><span class="run-in">A graduate of Oxford University,</span> Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing while at <abbr title="European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</abbr>, the European <a href="" title="">Particle Physics Laboratory</a>, in 1989. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URIs</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> were refined as Web technology spread.</p>
		<p>The internet has and is transforming the world, providing access to the sum of all human knowledge, for everyone and exponentially increasing the spread of information. His pioneering work is arguably the <em>most significant contribution</em> to mankind in history.</p>

		<p>While an independent contractor at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN" title="Read the wikipedia article for CERN">CERN</a> from June to December 1980, Berners-Lee proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. While there, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.</p>
		<p>After leaving CERN in 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, England. The project he worked on was a real-time remote procedure call which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984 he returned to CERN as a fellow.</p>
		<p>In 1989, CERN was the <a href="" title="">largest Internet node</a> in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>&ldquo;I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and-ta-da!&mdash;the World Wide Web.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.&rdquo;</p>
